    <h2>Understanding Credit</h2>
    <p>Credit allows you to borrow money to buy goods or services now and pay later, often with interest. Responsible use of credit helps build trust with lenders, while poor management can lead to debt and financial stress. Learning how to handle credit wisely is an important part of financial literacy.</p>

    <h2>What is a Credit Score?</h2>
    <p>Your credit score is a three-digit number that shows how trustworthy you are as a borrower. Lenders use it to decide whether to give you a loan and what interest rate to charge. The higher your score, the better your financial opportunities.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excellent (750+):</strong> Eligible for the best loan rates and credit offers.</li>
      <li><strong>Good (700–749):</strong> Generally favorable loan terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair (650–699):</strong> May face higher interest rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Poor (below 650):</strong> High risk; may be denied credit or offered costly terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Build and Maintain Good Credit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always pay your bills on time — payment history is the biggest factor in your credit score.</li>
      <li>Keep your credit card balance below 30% of your credit limit.</li>
      <li>Avoid applying for too many new accounts in a short time.</li>
      <li>Regularly check your credit report for errors and dispute them if found.</li>
      <li>Use credit responsibly — borrow only what you can afford to repay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Loans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Loans:</strong> Used for general purposes like emergencies or home improvements. Usually unsecured (no collateral).</li>
      <li><strong>Student Loans:</strong> Help pay for education and are often offered at lower interest rates with flexible repayment options.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto Loans:</strong> Used to finance the purchase of a vehicle. The car itself often serves as collateral.</li>
      <li><strong>Mortgage Loans:</strong> Long-term loans for buying property. Missing payments can lead to foreclosure.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Loans:</strong> Used to start or expand a business, often requiring a solid plan and collateral.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding Interest and Repayment</h2>
    <p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money. The rate depends on your credit score, loan type, and lender. A small difference in interest rate can greatly affect the total amount you repay.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you borrow ₦500,000 at 10% annual interest for 3 years, you’ll pay back around ₦665,500 — meaning ₦165,500 goes to interest alone. Always compare lenders before accepting any loan.</p>

    <h2>How to Manage Debt Wisely</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>List all your debts (amount owed, interest rate, due date).</li>
      <li>Pay off high-interest loans first to save money long-term.</li>
      <li>Consider consolidating multiple debts into one loan with a lower interest rate.</li>
      <li>Communicate with lenders if you’re struggling — many offer temporary relief or lower payments.</li>
      <li>Avoid using new loans to repay old ones unless it reduces your total cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Signs of Unhealthy Credit Habits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using loans or credit cards for everyday expenses like groceries or rent.</li>
      <li>Missing payments or paying only the minimum balance.</li>
      <li>Regularly borrowing money to repay other debts.</li>
      <li>Ignoring or avoiding your debt statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Responsible Borrowing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Borrow only when necessary — for education, business, or essential purchases.</li>
      <li>Compare loan terms, interest rates, and repayment options before signing.</li>
      <li>Understand all fees, including late penalties and service charges.</li>
      <li>Build an emergency fund to avoid relying on loans during tough times.</li>
      <li>Stay organized — track all your credit accounts and payment dates.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Final Advice</h2>
    <p>Credit can be a powerful tool or a dangerous trap — it depends on how you use it. Responsible credit use can open doors to home ownership, education, and business opportunities. But unmanaged debt can cause stress and limit your financial freedom. Be smart, stay disciplined, and use credit as a stepping stone toward your goals.</p>
