    <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
    <p>Investing allows your money to grow over time, helping you build wealth, achieve financial goals, and beat inflation. Instead of letting your money sit idle in a savings account, investing puts it to work through ownership, interest, or growth opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Key Investment Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Start Early:</strong> Time is your greatest asset. The earlier you start investing, the more you benefit from compounding — earning returns on both your initial investment and past gains.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Diversify:</strong> Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Understand Risk:</strong> Every investment has some level of risk. Learn your risk tolerance and invest accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Stay Consistent:</strong> Regular contributions (even small ones) build wealth over time through discipline and patience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in a company that can grow in value and pay dividends. Great for long-term growth but volatile in the short term.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans to governments or corporations that pay back interest. Lower risk than stocks but with smaller returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual Funds & ETFs:</strong> Pooled investments that offer diversification and professional management, ideal for beginners.</li>
      <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Investing in land or property can provide rental income and long-term appreciation.</li>
      <li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Assets like gold, oil, or agricultural products that protect against inflation but can be volatile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Start Investing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>1. Set Clear Goals:</strong> Define why you’re investing — retirement, education, or wealth building.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Educate Yourself:</strong> Learn basic financial concepts like risk, diversification, and compounding.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Choose a Platform:</strong> Open an investment account with a reputable brokerage or financial app.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Start Small:</strong> Even with little money, you can invest in fractional shares or low-cost ETFs.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Be Patient:</strong> Investing is long-term. Avoid reacting to short-term market swings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Understanding Compound Interest</h2>
    <p>Compound interest is when you earn interest on your interest. For example, if you invest ₦100,000 at 10% annual return, you’ll have ₦110,000 after one year. In the second year, you earn interest on ₦110,000, not just ₦100,000 — and this keeps growing every year!</p>

    <h2>Common Investing Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Chasing Quick Profits:</strong> Avoid get-rich-quick schemes or speculative investments without research.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Ignoring Fees:</strong> High management or trading fees can eat into your returns over time.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Emotional Decisions:</strong> Market ups and downs are normal — stay calm and stick to your plan.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Not Reinvesting Dividends:</strong> Reinvesting helps compound your wealth faster.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Long-Term Investment Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Index Investing:</strong> Invest in broad market indexes (like the S&P 500) to match market growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging:</strong> Invest a fixed amount regularly to reduce the impact of market volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Retirement Accounts:</strong> Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Rebalancing:</strong> Periodically adjust your portfolio to maintain your preferred risk level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <p>If you invest ₦50,000 monthly for 10 years with an 8% annual return, you’ll have approximately ₦9.1 million. That’s the power of consistency and compounding — your small monthly investments grow exponentially over time.</p>

    <h2>Final Advice</h2>
    <p>Investing is not about timing the market — it’s about time <em>in</em> the market. Be patient, informed, and disciplined. Focus on your goals, review your portfolio regularly, and keep learning.</p>
